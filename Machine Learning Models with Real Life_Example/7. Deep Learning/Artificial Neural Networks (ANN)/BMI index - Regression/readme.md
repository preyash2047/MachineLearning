Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) 
<hr>

In this program, I have made a model predict the BMI index based on Gender's Height and weight.
<br>

# Conclusion

> I have used data of 500 person Gender, Height, Weight and Index

> data terms:

1. Gender : Male / Female
2. Height: Number (cm)
3. Weight: Number (Kg)
4. Index :
  * 0 - Extremely Weak
  * 1 - Weak
  * 2 - Normal
  * 3 - Overweight
  * 4 - Obesity
  * 5 - Extreme Obesity

> Conclusion:
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) model gave the get the accuracy of 83.20 % whereas Random Forest regressor got the accuracy of 95 %, So it is too much important to select the right algorithm for the respective problem
