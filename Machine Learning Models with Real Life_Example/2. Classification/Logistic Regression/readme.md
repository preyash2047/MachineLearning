Logistic Classifier
<hr>

In this program, I have made a model classify the patient may have heart disease or not.
<br>

> # Conclusion

> In this model I have used data of 303 patient's healh of heart 

> data terms:
*   age - age in years
*   sex - (1 = male; 0 = female)
*   cp - chest pain type
*   trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
*   chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl
*   fbs - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
*   restecg - resting electrocardiographic results
*   thalach - maximum heart rate achieved
*   exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
*   oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
*   slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
*   ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
*   thal - 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
*   target - have disease or not (1=yes, 0=no)

> Conclusion:
Logistic Classifier model is has given the accuracy of 82%
