> In this model I have used data of 400 users dataset

> Conclusion:
Grid Search: we found the best Hyper Parameter for our model on the bases of data and best Parametsa are 'C': 0.5, 'gamma': 0.6, 'kernel': 'rbf'

K-Fold: Confusion Matrix has given the accuracy of 93.00 %, and then we have applied K-Fold and we found average result as 90.33% and Standard deviation as 6.57%
